# P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP
This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project demonstrates how to build an interactive conversational agent capable of understanding and responding to user inputs.

# Features
Interactive Chat Interface: Communicate with the chatbot in natural language.
Natural Language Understanding: Leverages NLP techniques for understanding user queries.
Customizable Responses: Easily modify and extend the bot’s responses.
Modular Design: Well-structured codebase for easy scalability and maintenance.
# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
re (Regular Expressions)
json (Data Parsing)
pickle (Data Serialization)
# Prerequisites
Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
Required Python libraries (can be installed using the command below)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Launch the chatbot using the command above.
Enter your query in the terminal and receive a response from the chatbot.
Customize intents and responses in the data/ directory to extend the chatbot’s functionality.
# Customization
To adapt the chatbot to your needs:

Modify the Intent File: Update the data/intents.json file with custom intents and responses.
Enhance NLP Logic: Modify the chatbot_logic.py script to incorporate additional NLP techniques or preprocessing steps.
